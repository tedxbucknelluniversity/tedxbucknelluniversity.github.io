            The inaugural TEDxBucknellUniversity was a huge success and is back for its second year.  TEDxBucknellUniversity looks to bring a day to explore thought-provoking, personal and possibly controversial ideas in the hopes of bringing those bold notions to life. This years theme, catalysts, aims to have speakers share their ideas and experiences of kickstarting change in all different fields.

Throughout his travels, he experienced how different people lived, but realized the potential in one common tool, the bicycle. Muyambi found that the bicycle provided access to recourses such as clean water, healthcare, and schools. He viewed them not just as bikes, but instead as life changing tools. In 2008 while attending Bucknell, Muyambi founded Bicycles Against Poverty, an organization that uses microfinance as a way to distribute bicycles across Uganda. This organization has not only been extremely successful in distributing bikes, but also offers workshops about financial management.
