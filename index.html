Throughout his travels, he experienced how different people lived, but realized the potential in one common tool, the bicycle. Muyambi found that the bicycle provided access to recourses such as clean water, healthcare, and schools. He viewed them not just as bikes, but instead as life changing tools. In 2008 while attending Bucknell, Muyambi founded Bicycles Against Poverty, an organization that uses microfinance as a way to distribute bicycles across Uganda. This organization has not only been extremely successful in distributing bikes, but also offers workshops about financial management.
