            The inaugural TEDxBucknellUniversity was a huge success and is back for its second year.  TEDxBucknellUniversity looks to bring a day to explore thought-provoking, personal and possibly controversial ideas in the hopes of bringing those bold notions to life. This years theme, catalysts, aims to have speakers share their ideas and experiences of kickstarting change in all different fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            Licensed by the Sapling Foundation — creator of the TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design), TEDGlobal and TEDxconference series — and supported by the College of Engineering, this event gives an equal forum to student, faculty and alumni speakers to share what they've learned in a series of brief presentations.

He set his sights on working with skis and began a career as a “Ski Testing Engineer” at Black Diamond Equipment after graduation.  As time went on, that role evolved, and at the age of 23, he was put in charge of a project to build a ski manufacturing facility from scratch in Asia, where he led a team of American and Chinese engineers to reach mass production in 18 months with a budget of 4.5 million dollars. When that project was completed, Dwyer decided to pursue a new challenge. He bought a 30-foot sailboat, learned to sail it, and navigated single-handedly more than 12,000 nautical miles from Bellingham, Washington to Chilean Patagonia.  Dwyer was inspired by the natural beauty (and horrific environmental damage) he saw during his voyage and decided to dedicate his life towards making the world more sustainable.  He is now a product manager for Renewable NRG Systems in Hinesburg, Vermont, where he focuses on helping the world make more renewable energy.' src="images/Haney.png" alt="Dwyer Haney" width="175" height="175">

          <span style="line-height:1.6">In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxBucknellUniversity, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxBucknellUniversity event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</span>
